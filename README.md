# Getting Started
This is a React App that listens to blocks created on port.  It uses Apollo GraphQL to send this to the client via a websocket.

## To setup the application
```bash
yarn
```

## To start the application
```bash
npm run dev
```
Note: yarn was having some issues with async andI didn't want to bloat the app by adding babel
